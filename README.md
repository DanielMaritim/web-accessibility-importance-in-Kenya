What is Web accessibility...
Accessibility is the practice of making webpages easily usable as possible by as many people of different background as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
I see accessibility as a right for every internet user.And its vital as Africa as a whole to embrace web accessibility.
 Providing  quality accessible webpages should be made a law so as to avoid discrimination, this will inturn open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be made accessible.It will also provide job opportunities for developers who specialize in web accessible websites.
A World Health Organization source maintains that about forty percent of Africa's population consists of people with disabilities, including 10-15 percent of school-age children. This percentage would translate into about 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.
So despite all the advancements in technology,there remains a huge gap in accessibility.We need to think of how to link Africans through the web and accessibility will help bridge this gap.
As developers we need to help bridge this gap with empathy and compassion knowing that for our products to impact more people we need to make it accessible to them.
Most government business is conducted on the web,with just a population unable to accessible these sites for one reason or the other,shows the huge gap that nees to be tackled.
Kenya’s constitution is strong on disability rights, outlawing discrimination on the grounds of disability in article 27(4); and providing that a person with disability shall be entitled to treatment with respect and dignity, access educational institutions and facilities, have reasonable access to all places, public transport and information, and access materials and devices including for communications.
Despite all these most website struggle with accessibility issues and are not placing accessibility issues as a priority.
While Kenya’s government is making significant steps to move its services online, the platforms are not favorable to those who are visually imparied.
So what can we as software developers do to change things,to be at the forefront of making sure web accessibilty is adopted and implemented as it should be.
