What is Web accessibility...
Accessibility is the practice of making webpages easily usable as possible by as many people of different background as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
I see accessibility as a right for every internet user.And its vital as Africa as a whole to embrace web accessibility.
