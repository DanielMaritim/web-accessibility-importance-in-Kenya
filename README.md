What is Web accessibility...
Accessibility is the practice of making webpages easily usable as possible by as many people of different background as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
I see accessibility as a right for every internet user.And its vital as Africa as a whole to embrace web accessibility.
 Providing  quality accessible webpages should be made a law so as to avoid discrimination, this will inturn open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be made accessible.It will also provide job opportunities for developers who specialize in web accessible websites.
A World Health Organization source maintains that about forty percent of Africa's population consists of people with disabilities, including 10-15 percent of school-age children. This percentage would translate into about 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.
